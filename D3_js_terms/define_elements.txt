# D3 library
- library for manipulating the DOM tree, in order to represent information visually


<svg>
- element as the location in the DOM tree to contain the graph

selectAll()
- functions accepts as CSS selector string and return matching nodes:
	- EG: select() only first match, and selectAll() a collection of all matching nodes

- <circle> elments inside svg
	- IN the example, there are'nt any ciricle elements inside SVG, but selectAll("circle)
	simply returns an empty collection (of <circle> elements)

- data()
	- function returns a collection of elements that have been assoicated with
	individual data points. In the current case, D3 cannot associate each data point
	with a <circle> because there aren't any circle elements.
