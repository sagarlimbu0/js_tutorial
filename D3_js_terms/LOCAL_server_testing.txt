# running local server through PYTHON 3
- For security reasons, we cannot directly load files into webserver through d3. we need to setup 
local server
- check the python ver: python3 -v
- change the directory where the INDEX.HTML file is located
- run the following syntax to run local server: for port 8888, if other service using, change the port
	python3 -m http.server 8888 &.

- Now, we can view the local server: localhost:8888 
- check the console for the objects passed through local files: CSV, JSON, etc.
